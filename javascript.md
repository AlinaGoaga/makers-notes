# Javascript

A general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. There a number of key differences from Ruby: stricter syntax, no classes, very flexible.

Unlike other languages, however, it's the only language which can be run in the browser â€“ on the client side (rather than the server side).

This allows for a number of advantages:

* dynamic page updates without needing to refresh
* increased speed and lower compute costs for the server

There are problems with it, too. All of a page's JS code is visible to, and editable by, the end user. So there are a number of processes that shouldn't happen client-side. As a result, JS tends to be used for UI enhancements on client-side.

Server-side JS implementations like Node.js are becoming more popular as well as they allow a development team to use the same language on both ends.
