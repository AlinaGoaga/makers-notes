# Pair programming

Pair programming or *pairing* is coding for two. One person types, the other person watches, and both discuss the code that's being written. After a set period of time, you switch roles.

A variation on this is *ping-pong pairing*, a method used in test-driven design, where one person writes a failing test, the other fixes the test and writes a new test, and so on.

Pairing, along with TDD proficiency, is considered a vital skill by many tech employers.
