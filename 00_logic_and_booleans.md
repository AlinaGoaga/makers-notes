# Logic and booleans

All of

```ruby
<
>
==
>=
<=
```

evaluate to true or false.

The fact that a variable is set makes it ```True```. Everything in Ruby is ```True``` unless it's ```False``` or ```nil```.

## Ternary operators

```ruby
<condition> ? <command_if_true> : <command_if_false>
```

Evaluates the condition and returns one of the two answers depending on its truthiness. A nice one-line truth test.
