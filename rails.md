# Rails

Rails is a popular web framework. Sinatra is a DSL, not a framework â€“ it gives you much more flexibility and fewer conventions when you're building a website. Rails is, well... like being on rails. There are fewer decisions for you to make, and more decisions that are made for you.

## Getting started

`gem install rails` will install the Rails gem. Expect it to take a while. `rails --help` gives a nice help menu.

Make a new Rails app:

`rails new yelp_clone -d postgresql -T`

The `-T` switch turns off the built-in Rails test suite. `-d` preconfigures your app for a particular type of database.
