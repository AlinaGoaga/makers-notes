# node.js

Node is a web application framework written in JavaScript.

Getting started can be as simple as serving up a .js file by running `node` at the command line.

In the node world, you have **npm** instead of RubyGems, Node Packaged Modules instead of Gems, and npm modules are installed locally by default, not globally. 

More likely, you'll want to use a generator like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and a framework like [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) to get started.
