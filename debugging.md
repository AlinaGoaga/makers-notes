# Debugging

When you encounter an error in testing, always read the error message carefully â€“ preferably read it aloud! Often, reading the error itself is enough to spot and fix the bug.

If not, look through the stack trace that appears below the error message, which will guide you through the lines of code that were executed when the error appeared. Look at those lines carefully to try and spot the error, using the error message and type to guide you.
