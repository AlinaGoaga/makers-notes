# Design Patterns

Just as there are repeated problems in architecture and engineering, so there are similar problems in programming. Design patterns, in computer science, are set ways of solving progamming problems.

* Decorator pattern
* Factory method
* Builder pattern
* Adapter pattern
* Visitor pattern

## Decorator methods

## Factory methods

## Builder methods

These are methods that initialize the objects you want to create.

You wouldn't start out using this method â€“ ideally, the pattern will emerge *as you are coding*.

## Adapter methods
